Notetaking, Introduction to Computation and Programming using Python

Ch. 1:

declarative knowledge

imperative knowledge

guess the square root by (guess + square/guess)/2

75 + 100/75 / 2 75.75/2 
37.1841

Turing completeness

Fixed program computer

algorithm definition, as like a recipe, a simple sequence of steps with a flow of control (as in a flow chart) and execut

computations

infix operators
literals

syntax

semantics

static semantics

    
Ch. 2: 

Objects Expressions and Numerical Types

Scalar, non scalar

integers, floating point numbers

Boolean: True and False

Operators and objects form expressions

== != > >= < <= + * / // - ( ) **

<< >> >>= <<= |= ^= ~= and or not

is
is not
is in
for x in
if x is not
if x is
if x in y
if not (x in y)

reserved words
